Iâ€™m currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Data Science** degree at PACE University in New York. I have hands-on experience training, optimizing, and deploying machine learning models, with skills in predictive analytics, feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model deployment. Iâ€™m driven to solve real-world challenges by building robust machine learning systems and enhancing model performance. I'm eager to contribute my results-driven mindset, technical expertise, and strategic thinking to drive innovation and deliver impactful results.
